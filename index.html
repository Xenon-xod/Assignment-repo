            <p>Checking and scrolling through social media has become an increasingly popular activity over the last
                decade. Although the majority of peoplesâ€™ use of social media is non-problematic, there is a small
                percentage of users that become addicted to social networking sites and engage in excessive or
                compulsive use. In fact, psychologists estimate that as many as 5 to 10% of Americans meet the criteria
                for social media addiction today. Social media addiction is a behavioral addiction that is characterized
                as being overly concerned about social media, driven by an uncontrollable urge to log on to or use
                social media, and devoting so much time and effort to social media that it impairs other important life
                areas.</p>
